# Kicad-droneosc

This is a very simple circuit based around S9018 NPN BJT's.

It creates a saw pulse and in this config I can modulate them via the base of the BJT. Its inspired by the work of [Kerry Wong](http://www.kerrywong.com/2014/03/19/bjt-in-reverse-avalanche-mode/) and [Sam Battle](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects/#/simplest-oscillator/)
